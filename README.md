# Employment Assessment App

## Project Overview
This app leverages AI to assess candidates’ fit based on customizable HR-defined criteria, including flexible cognitive assessments that allow candidates to choose the type best suited to their cognitive strengths.

## Key Features
- **Modular Assessment Criteria**: Allows HR to define, customize, and weigh various criteria based on role requirements.
- **Flexible Cognitive Assessment Options**: Supports multiple assessment types (e.g., Raven’s Progressive Matrices for visual processors).
- **Role-Specific Configurations**: Enables HR to tailor assessment requirements and weights by job role.
- **Candidate-Friendly Interface**: Provides guidance on selecting assessments best aligned with each candidate’s cognitive strengths.
- **Core Values Module**: Allows HR to adjust weightings for core values like collaboration, innovation, and adaptability.

## Technologies
- **Backend**: Python, Django/Flask
- **Frontend**: React or Vue.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow/PyTorch

## High-Level Roadmap
### Phase 1: Criteria Definition & Data Preparation

- Implement HR interface for defining and managing criteria, including adding, removing, and adjusting assessment criteria, as well as defining weights for each criterion.

### Phase 2: Model Development
- Train predictive models for scoring assessments.
- Integrate AI modules with assessment results.

### Phase 3: User Interface Design
- Develop candidate and HR interfaces for selecting assessments and customizing criteria.

### Phase 4: Testing & Evaluation
- Conduct extensive testing to ensure accuracy and bias-free assessments.

### Phase 5: Deployment & Maintenance
- Deploy the app and set up monitoring and continuous improvement cycles.
